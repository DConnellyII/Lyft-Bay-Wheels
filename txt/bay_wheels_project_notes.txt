* Data was broken down into 5 separate CSV files for the months of January through May.

* I created a Jupyter Notebook file to combine all of my CSV's into a dataframe using Pandas to export into one CSV file.

* After reviewing the datatypes of my columns, I realized that a few of them were floats when they should have been ints. I added that into the code.

* While doing an initial scan of the data, I noticed that February was spelled incorrectly, so I included a script to correct it.

* When I went to push the cleaned CSV to github, I received an error for the file size being too big. I zipped the files.

* I went into the cleaned data CSV and rearranged my columns to have better clarity.

* I also noticed that I didnt have any data to represent where this would physically be. I went through the map on the Lyft website to eventually include the starting and ending location (city/state) to be able to use in Tableau.

* To more easily update my data, I imported the CSV file into PostgreSQL. This allowed me to update the start and ending locations more efficiently. I also used SQL to make sure the names of the stations matched what was reflected on the Lyft website.

* I decided to figure out what I could eliminate from the data that might not be useful and found that the "member_birth_year" column had some misinformation. I then decided that everything before 1939 would be stripped from the data since that would make the riders age be over 80 years old in 2019.

* I also took a look at "member_gender" and saw that outside of "Male" and "Female" there was an "Other" option. I opted to get rid of the "Other" option for my analysis.

* Decided to focus on San Francisco. It contains roughly 2/3rd of the data meaning that area has the most activity. May focus on Oakland, Berkeley and Emeryville seperate from San Jose on another visualization.
