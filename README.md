* Anonymized bike trip data from Jan 2019 to May 2019

I will build a set of data reports to provide insight into the program's utilization. The reports could be used by the city officials looking to publicize and improve the service.

I plan to try to tackle several questions involving the data including:

* How many trips have been recorded in total?

* By what percentage does total ridership change (+/-)?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used?

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

I plan to also include a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
